This is my first project, that involves API calls. 

Currently trying to get back to Java, so I decided to use it.
In the future I am planning on writing more description on here.

[Helpful info] :
Weather.java - method getJSONValue is recursively able to go through the json, if there is more layers to it (eg. input is "parent:child:name", the method will get to name of specified child of a parent)

[Note] :
Input query is not tested in any way, in this case, it should only lead to API call fail.
